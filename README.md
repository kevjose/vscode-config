Umang's Config/Settings for VS Code.

### What's the point of this repo?

I often find myself reconfiguring VS Code to my liking every time I switch a laptop. It only makes sense to keep the config stored at a place I can copy from any time I want, and people can use my config if they find it useful.

## IMPORTANT
Back your config up before you replace it with mine.
